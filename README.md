This system is PHP Language and CSS made only. The system's primary goal is to give a set of features such as Patient Registration, in which the added patient is stored to the generated database using phpmyadmin as an auto increment. The encoded patient can be viewed by the user account by default in the patient list, but they do not have the ability to alter the information. Only the admin account has the ability to edit, update and delete patient information for Data Privacy and Compliance. In addition to Advanced Search & Filtering, I just used the % function at the beginning and end of the "search" command to display sounds LIKE first or last name.
